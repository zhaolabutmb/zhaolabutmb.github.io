I"å<p>Dr. Zhiyuan Song (å®‹çŸ¥è¿œ) is a postdoc fellow (2025-) in the lab. He holds a B.S. in physics from Sun Yat-sen University and a PhD degree in biophysics from Clemson University. During his PhD studies with <a href="https://dlab.clemson.edu/">Dr. Feng Ding</a>, he focused on amyloid protein aggregation and interactions, gaining extensive experience in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, ML/AI, and biological data analysis to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying protein and protein complex folding. His current research involves development of computational models on predicting protein-protein binding affinity using computational biophysics and advanced AI models such as transformer, graph neural network, and so on.</p>

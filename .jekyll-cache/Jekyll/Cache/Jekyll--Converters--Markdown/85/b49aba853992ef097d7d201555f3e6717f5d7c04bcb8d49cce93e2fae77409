I"œ<p>Dr. Zhao is an assistant professor in the <a href="https://bmb.utmb.edu/people/faculty/bios/zhao">Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology</a> and the <a href="https://www.utmb.edu/scsb/bios/haiqing-zhao-phd">Sealy Center for Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics</a> at UTMB. His interests in studying biological complexity went back to his college time especially from reading SchrÃ¶dingerâ€™s book <em>What is Life?</em>. In his undergraduate time, he started to use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate nanoscale phenomena in ionic liquids. For his PhD, he studied histone assembly with Dr. <a href="https://chem.umd.edu/people/garegin-papoian">Garegin Papoian</a> and Dr. <a href="https://irp.nih.gov/pi/yamini-dalal">Yamini Dalal</a> through the joint <a href="https://ipst.umd.edu/research/nci">UMD-NCI partnership program</a> between the University of Maryland and the National Cancer Institute of NIH. Through multi-scale computational simulations, his series of thesis works uncovered the folding principles and energetics of histones assembly, including their centromeric variant and associated chaperones. During his postdoc with Dr. <a href="https://honig.c2b2.columbia.edu/">Barry Honig</a> at Columbia University Medical School, Dr. Zhao transitioned to systems biology, developing machine learning methods to predict genome-wide protein-protein interactions. He is broadly interested in applying physical sciences and ML/AI methods to study biology questions. Current projects include predicting host-pathogen interactomes and studying the post-translational machinery in epigenetics. Please click <a href="/Research">research</a> to find more.</p>

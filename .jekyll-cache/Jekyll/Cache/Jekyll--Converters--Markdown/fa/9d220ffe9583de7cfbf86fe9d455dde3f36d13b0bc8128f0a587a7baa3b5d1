I"<p>Ziyu Shi (Âè≤Á¥´Â†â) is a visiting MD-PhD student in Gastroenterologists from Zhengzhou University in China. Besides clinical research experience in gastrointestinal and liver diseases, Ziyu is passionate about learning advanced sequence-based bioinformatis and AI-driven multi-omics approaches. He is interested in integrating single-cell, spatial transcriptomics, as well as proteomics to understand disease from the molecular level, which may also accelerate the development of precision medicine. Currently Ziyu is leading a project on modeling liver diseases with single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics data, collabrating with the <a href="https://www.utmb.edu/pathology/research-laboratories/stevenson-lerner-saldarriaga-lab/home">Stevenson-Lerner/Saldarriaga Lab</a> at UTMB.</p>

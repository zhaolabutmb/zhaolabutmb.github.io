I"ç<p>We launched our group website. Welcome to check it out and please let us know if you find any errors!</p>

<p>This website is built with Jekyll, which takes Markdown file and generates HTML styled with CSS. We used a template originally written by Dr. <a href="https://bedford.io/team/trevor-bedford/">Trevor Bedford</a>. We thank Dr. <a href="https://www.shisguang.com/about">Guang Shi</a> for helpful discussions on static HTML generators. The <a href="https://github.com/hzhao-lab/hzhao-lab.github.io">source code</a> is uploaded on GitHub.</p>

<p>This website is maintained by the lab. We also have another <a href="https://www.utmb.edu/scsb/labgroups/zhao/welcome">group webpage</a> maintained by SCSB scientific computing team.</p>

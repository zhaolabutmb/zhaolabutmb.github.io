I"<p>Our first collabration paper at UTMB was published. Dr. Zhao helped Dr. <a href="https://med.uth.edu/imm/2023/07/07/sheng-zhang-phd/">Sheng Zhang</a>â€™s group at UT Health with the free energy calculation for the huntingtin HTT and Hap40 proteins. Through the hybrid structural and functional studies of the fly and human HTT-HAP40 complexes, <a href="/papers/HTT_HAP40">this work</a> demonstrated that structural similarity underlies the functional conservation of the two complexes in these evolutionarily distant species.</p>

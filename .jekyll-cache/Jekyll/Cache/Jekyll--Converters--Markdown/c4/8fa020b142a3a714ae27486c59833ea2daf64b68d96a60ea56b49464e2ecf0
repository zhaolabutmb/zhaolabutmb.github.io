<p>Accumulation of somatic hypermutation (SHM) is the primary mechanism to enhance the binding affinity of antibodies to antigens in vivo. However, the structural basis of the effects of many SHMs remains elusive. Here, we integrated atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and data mining to build a high-throughput structural bioinformatics pipeline to study the effects of individual and combination SHMs on antibody conformation, flexibility, stability, and affinity. By applying this pipeline, we characterized a common mechanism of modulation of heavy-light pairing orientation by frequent SHMs at framework positions 39H, 91H, 38L, and 87L through disruption of a conserved hydrogen-bond network. Q39LH alone and in combination with light chain framework 4 (FWR4L) insertions further modulated the elbow angle between variable and constant domains of many antibodies, resulting in improved binding affinity for a subset of anti-HIV-1 antibodies. Q39LH also alleviated aggregation induced by FWR4L insertion, suggesting remote epistasis between these SHMs. Altogether, this study provides tools and insights for understanding antibody affinity maturation and for engineering functionally improved antibodies.</p>

<p>Histones compact and store DNA in both Eukarya and Archaea, forming heterodimers in Eukarya and homodimers in Archaea. Despite this, the folding mechanism of histones across species remains unclear. Our study addresses this gap by investigating 11 types of histone and histone-like proteins across humans, Drosophila, and Archaea through multi- scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, complemented by NMR and circular dichroism experiments. We confirm and elaborate on the widely applied ‚Äúfolding upon binding‚Äù mecha- nism of histone dimeric proteins and report a new alternative conformation, namely, the inverted non-native dimer, which may be a thermodynamically metastable configuration. Protein sequence analysis indicated that the inverted conformation arises from the hidden ancestral head-tail sequence symmetry underlying all histone proteins, which is congruent with the previously proposed histone evolution hypotheses. Finally, to explore the potential formations of homodimers in Eukarya, we utilized MD-based AWSEM and AI-based Alpha- Fold-Multimer models to predict their structures and conducted extensive all-atom MD simu- lations to examine their respective structural stabilities. Our results suggest that eukaryotic histones may also form stable homodimers, whereas their disordered tails bring significant structural asymmetry and tip the balance towards the formation of commonly observed het- erotypic dimers.</p>

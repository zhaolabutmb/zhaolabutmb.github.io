I"x<p>In July, <a href="/team/rui-tang">Rui Tang</a> arrived in Galveston to begin his research internship with us. <a href="/team/jack-plewa">Jack (Plewa) Tiller </a> started a rotation project focusing on aerospace omics, and <a href="/team/gary-sun">Gary Sun</a>, a talented undergraduate, joined us as an intern.</p>

<p>Earlier in June, <a href="/team/raymond-wang">Raymond Wang</a> started an internship with us (remotely for now). Interestingly, Raymond and Gary are from the same school and same major (EE/CS, Berkeley) but they havenâ€™t known each other. The world is small!</p>

<p>Welcome, Raymond, Jack, Rui and Gary!</p>

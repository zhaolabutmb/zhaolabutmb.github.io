# Brief introduction

This is the source code for Dr. [Haiqing Zhao](https://bmb.utmb.edu/people/faculty/bios/zhao)'s research group [website](https://zhaolabutmb.github.io) at the University of Texas Medical Branch. It is built using the customized Jekyll system for academics. Jekyll takes Markdown files and generates HTML styled with CSS. In building this website, we referenced templates and ideas from [Bedford lab](https://bedford.io/misc/about/) (the original author), [Nielson lab](https://nielsen-lab.github.io/), [Shen lab](https://www.columbia.edu/~ys2411/), and so on. Valuable discussions with [Guang Shi](https://www.shisguang.com/) on static HTML generators were also helpful in bringing this website to life.

A minimum manual for content updates: 
- Edit the `index.html` in root path to update the Homepage. 
- Similarly, edit the `index.html` inside each Tab folder: `Research/`, `Papers/`, `News/`, and `Team/` to update respective pages. 
- Inside each Tab folder, look for the `_posts/` and edit these markdown files for detailed post contents.
- `_layout/` folder has all the layouts that each page imports.

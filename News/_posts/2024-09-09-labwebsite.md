We launched our group website. Welcome to check it out and please let us know if you find any errors!

This website is built with Jekyll, which takes Markdown file and generates HTML styled with CSS. We used a template originally written by Dr. [Trevor Bedford] [3]. We thank Dr. [Guang Shi] [2] for helpful discussions on static HTML generators. The [source code] [4] is uploaded on GitHub.

This website is maintained by the lab. We also have another [group webpage] [1] maintained by SCSB scientific computing team.

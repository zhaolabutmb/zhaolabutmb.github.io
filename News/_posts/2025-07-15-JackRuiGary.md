In July, [Rui Tang]({{ site.baseurl }}/team/rui-tang) arrived in Galveston to begin his research internship with us. [Jack (Plewa) Tiller ]({{ site.baseurl }}/team/jack-plewa) started a rotation project focusing on aerospace omics, and [Gary Sun]({{ site.baseurl }}/team/gary-sun), a talented undergraduate, joined us as an intern. 

Earlier in June, [Raymond Wang]({{ site.baseurl }}/team/raymond-wang) started an internship with us (remotely for now). Interestingly, Raymond and Gary are from the same school and same major (EE/CS, Berkeley) but they haven't known each other. The world is small!

Welcome, Raymond, Jack, Rui and Gary!

Our first collabration paper at UTMB was published. Dr. Zhao helped Dr. [Sheng Zhang][1]'s group at UT Health with the free energy calculation for the huntingtin HTT and Hap40 proteins. Through the hybrid structural and functional studies of the fly and human HTT-HAP40 complexes, [this work]({{ site.baseurl }}/papers/HTT_HAP40) demonstrated that structural similarity underlies the functional conservation of the two complexes in these evolutionarily distant species.

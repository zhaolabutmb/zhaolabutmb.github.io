In Apr 2025, Dr. [Barry Honig] [1], pionner in protein eletrastatics, molecular biophysics and computational biology, visited UTMB. He met with our trainees at SCSB, engaged with lab members, and delivered a departmental seminar on neuronal self-recognition and clustered protocadherin protein. [This work][2] was later published in *Nature*.

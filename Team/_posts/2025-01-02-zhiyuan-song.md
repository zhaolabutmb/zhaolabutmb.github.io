Dr. Zhiyuan Song (宋知远) is a postdoc fellow (2025-) in the lab. He holds a B.S. in physics from Sun Yat-sen University and a PhD degree in biophysics from Clemson University. During his PhD studies with [Dr. Feng Ding][1], he focused on amyloid protein aggregation and interactions, gaining extensive experience in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, ML/AI, and biological data analysis to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying protein and protein complex folding. His current research involves development of computational models on predicting protein-protein binding affinity using computational biophysics and advanced AI models such as transformer, graph neural network, and so on.

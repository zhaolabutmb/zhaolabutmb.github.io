Dr. Zhao is an assistant professor in the [Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology][5] and the [Sealy Center for Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics][6] at UTMB. His interests in studying biological complexity went back to his college time especially from reading Schrödinger's book <em>What is Life?</em>. In his undergraduate time, he started to use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate nanoscale phenomena in ionic liquids. For his PhD, he studied histone assembly with Dr. [Garegin Papoian][1] and Dr. [Yamini Dalal][2] through the joint [UMD-NCI partnership program][3] between the University of Maryland and the National Cancer Institute of NIH. Through multi-scale computational simulations, his series of thesis works uncovered the folding principles and energetics of histones assembly, including their centromeric variant and associated chaperones. During his postdoc with Dr. [Barry Honig][4] at Columbia University Medical School, Dr. Zhao transitioned to systems biology, developing machine learning methods to predict genome-wide protein-protein interactions. He is broadly interested in applying physical sciences and ML/AI methods to study biology questions. Current projects include predicting host-pathogen interactomes and studying the post-translational machinery in epigenetics. Please click research page to find more.

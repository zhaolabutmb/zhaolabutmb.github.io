Ziyu Shi (史紫堉) is a visiting MD-PhD student in Gastroenterologists from Zhengzhou University in China. Besides clinical research experience in gastrointestinal and liver diseases, Ziyu is passionate about learning advanced sequence-based bioinformatis and AI-driven multi-omics approaches. He is interested in integrating single-cell, spatial transcriptomics, as well as proteomics to understand disease from the molecular level, which may also accelerate the development of precision medicine. Currently Ziyu is leading a project on modeling liver diseases with single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics data, collabrating with the [Stevenson-Lerner/Saldarriaga Lab][1] at UTMB.
